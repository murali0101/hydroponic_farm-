          There is a great need for an automation system in hydroponic farming.
          This is because of the works that require a lot of accuracies. Some of
          the work is also hard to be done by a human. Therefore, to decrease
          the workload of the farmers, the automation system is necessary. It is
          excellent for production as all the works in farming requires less
          time and effort. Automated hydroponic farming systems in India have
          started recently on a large scale. Since there are many farmers who
          want to increase their efficiency. Automation system also helps in
          lowering the labor cost which is a great help to the farmers. ​<br />
          Our smart farming technologies will help you in farming with a lot
          more efficiency. There are many types of hydroponic farming equipment
          available in our automation section like fertigation and dosing
          controllers. It helps in providing crops with a specific amount of
          fertilizer by mixing it in the water. This equipment is very helpful
          in commercial farming. Also, nutrients are provided to the roots with
          their help. This is not in the case of the normal irrigation system.
          Therefore, fertigation and dosing controller has an upper hand on it.
          These contain sensors that detect many factors like temperature,
          amount of sunlight and etc. This helps in saving water and nutrients.
          ​<br />
          ​ Farm automation is necessary for the betterment of hydroponic or
          aeroponic farming. It saves a lot of resources of farmers and,
          therefore, helps the farmer to a great extent. Also, with the rise in
          demand, farmers have to accept the automation system for fast as well
          as quality production. There are many more factors like pricing and
          labor which are also changing with time. Therefore, there is a need
          for automation system in farming. Due to the growth of technology,
          modern farming has started to use it for efficient growth of the
          crops. We are, therefore, providing you with all the facilities to
          make your plant growth easier as well more effective. Farmers are also
          facing a shortage of labors and are facing a lot of trouble. As a
          result, the automation system comes into play. ​<br />
          We will provide you with many more farm automation systems like
          automation timer, temperature controllers, humidity controllers,
          buzzers and etc. Automation timer contains different timers like
          reserving timer, priming timer and etc. These timers are necessary for
          providing nutrients as well as water for a certain amount of time.
          Therefore, helps in over-watering and over-nutrition. Temperature and
          humidity controllers help in controlling the temperature as well as
          humidity to provide plants with an optimal environment. You will get
          the information about all the problems with the help of buzzer.
